This list is ordered chronologically, so if you want to see the newest changes,
you'll have to scroll alllllll the way down.


18-08-07: 1.0
Everything's new (started development on 29-01-05)
Based on Sega Li, my NES emulator, with some additional features like netplay,
savestates/movies, and realtime reverse. Core is pretty complete and accurate.

01-09-07: 1.0.1
- various small changes
- timing: increased maximum Z80 overclock percentage from 400% to 9999%,
  increased maximum speed up factor from 5 to 10
- fixed D3D mirror mode not working properly with the Arkanoid pad
- fixed dialog comboboxes having a height of 0 on some computers
- gfx: made DirectX 9 optional, so it won't refuse to run with older versions
  anymore (D3D9.DLL error), the current minimum requirement is DirectX 7

12-02-08: 1.0.2
I haven't been working on meisei for a few months, so I decided to release the
latest build. Development will continue, some day.

- added basic SCC deform register emulation


01-03-08: 1.1
- gfx: fixed DDraw renderer border refresh bug
- input: corrected keyboard matrix quirk
- changed power-on timing, to prevent "A Life M36 Planet" from locking up
- added movie time code view option on play/record (hh:mm:ss;ff)
- VDP: you can now disable/enable sprite and tile layers
- VDP: added unlimited sprites option. This eliminates sprite flickering on
  most games, without affecting core accuracy: collision and overflow bits
  still work the same. Games that use overflow as a trick to hide sprite
  lines, like Athletic Land when falling into the water, will show glitches.
- sound: added "triple buffering" to prevent overflows on longer frames
- timing: speed up setting is now in percentage instead of integer multiply
- timing: added slowdown feature, working similar to speed up (default: F10)
- gfx: auto save palette didn't work
- input: added "invert" function for axes
- input: limited the speed of DInput reads, instead of always at every vblank.
  It sometimes returned wrong values in fast forward mode.
- timing: added direct control over frame speed/reverse with an analogue axis,
  by default mouse Y axis while holding F10 + F12. I call it DJ scratching,
  since it kind of resembles that.
- mappers: added AMD flash memory emulation, and Matra's INK mapper. One INK
  cartridge died in the process (no, not inkjet), curses were heard as far
  away as planet Gradius.
- fixed crash when opening an SCC game by drag-dropping, while that same SCC
  game was already running

02-03-08: 1.1.1
- mappers: AMD flash erase sector/chip command didn't work properly
- changed default video format to PAL, per default C-BIOS region code
- gfx: fullscreen setting is now saved, so it's possible to start meisei in
  full screen

29-03-08: 1.1.2
- fixed movie timecode setting always saving as "no"
- added support for movie subtitles, it's even possible to create things like:
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW4BR4Yy4m4
- mappers: traded meisei SRAM support for a nice picture of Audrey Tautou from
  AuroraMSX. Added ASCII 8 + SRAM, ASCII 16 + SRAM, Koei, Konami Game Master 2,
  Manuel Mega Flash ROM SCC, and Panasonic PAC mapper types.
- PSG: fixed noise period of 0 being able to go negative
- Z80: IRQ timing was 1 cycle off


31-08-08: 1.2
meisei's website moved to http://hap.samor.nl/

- input: fixed keyboard matrix ghosting on more than 2 rows
- input: fixed DirectInput lag
- fixed possible memory leak with on-screen messages
- moved enable/disable on-screen messages to the GUI menu (previously, it was
  just in the .ini file)
- mappers: added Korean bootleg multicarts: 80-in-1, 90-in-1, and 126-in-1
- mappers: bought and reverse engineered Cross Blaim and Harry Fox mappers,
  their emulation should be almost completely accurate now
- mappers: added Konami Sound Cartridge, SCC-I with 128KB RAM
- mappers: fixed stupid crash when loading savestates with SRAM mappers
- mappers: added preliminary support for Zemina ZMB hardware

- input: added Konami HyperShot controller emulation
- input: added Torikeshi/Jikkou keys, available on some Panasonic MSXes
- input: added support for Sony's hardware pause key
- mappers: fixed SCC power-on state, the music in Nerlaska's Monster Hunter
  was broken
- gfx: fixed a few NTSC renderer bugs and made S-Video the default video
  signal, if it's too slow for you, change it to RGB
- added a powerful tile viewer, with support for loading/saving tables or SCx
  files, and a built-in editor similar to Wolf's Polka
- added a sprite viewer, with similar features to the tile viewer, like changing
  the Indian's expression to http://hap.samor.nl/meisei_archive/magdance.gif
- added custom savestate/movie slot, allowing any filename instead of the
  numbered defaults
- added support for saving screenshots
- PSG: added support for AY8910 (only configurable in the .ini file for now)
- added a PSG logger, allowing you to to log raw, MIDI, or YM files. YM files can
  be played back, on eg. Ay_Emul ( http://bulba.untergrund.net/emulator_e.htm ).
  http://hap.samor.nl/meisei_archive/Infinite%20-%20Universe%20Unknown.zip , and
  http://hap.samor.nl/meisei_archive/Konami%20-%20Usas.zip for example.
- PSG: added output viewer, with currently played notes on a piano bar
- PSG: added support for substituting simple waveforms with the default
  squarewaves, including many presets by Wolf, and a wave editor
- gfx: made the palette editor easier to use, and included a few more presets
- included yet another game by Infinite, Montana John and the Templar's Treasure

03-09-08: 1.2.1
Regarding movies, this version is fully compatible with 1.2.

21-10-08: 1.2.2
- tile and sprite viewer can be resized
- added support for fMSX CAS images (tapes), including the ability to save
  separate blocks, and import common MSX files normally meant for MSX disks.
  Be aware that you'll need an official BIOS ROM to be able to play tape games.
- PSG: moved chip type configuration to the GUI
- VDP: added chip type configuration: TMS9118, TMS9129, TMS9918A, and TMS9929A
  (TMSxx18 is NTSC/J, can also be TMSxx28. TMSxx29 is PAL)
- VDP: enabled 4KB mode address bus mangling for TMS99xxA
- VDP: added M3 sprite cloning quirk
- fixed tile viewer screen loader BLOAD header detection

23-11-08: 1.2.3
- added setting to overrule checksum when loading states or movies, handy if
  you're ROM hacking and made savestates on an earlier hack revision
- Z80: fixed a couple of undocumented details not caught by test programs
- input: added PC keyboard LED flags for trigger rules
- input: you can now grab the mouse pointer (Ctrl+Shift+M), making games like
  Arkanoid easier to control
- input: fixed Sony pause key conflict with default pause shortcut
- added support for Sony's Magic Key dongle, a simple cheat device that can be
  used with Gall Force (and a couple of MSX2 games)

- mappers: fixed Irem TAM-S1 (R-Type) mapper range
- mappers: added ROM mirroring quirk to Konami types

  inspired from Marat's fMSX
- mappers: removed Zemina ZMB type, no dumps exist in order to test it
- mappers: added optional extra settings per type, instead of all mapper types
  being identified and auto-configured with a single id

  register at the same time the vblank bit gets set
- VDP: added Toshiba T6950/T7937A model
- added a firmware downloader, for indirectly obtaining essentials, such as
  BIOS files, this will also check for meisei updates

09-02-10: 1.3.1
My website, which happens to be meisei's home too (whoa), was relocated again,
this time to http://tsk-tsk.net/ . Let's hope it stays there.
The biggest changes in this release are MSX mouse support, requested by Trilobyte,
and trackball support, surprisingly supported in more games than I expected,
like Eddy II, Fruit Search, Hole in One(+Pro), Space Trouble, Super Billiards.

- added support for 1/2/4KB RAM, MSXtra works now
- if you're too lazy to type a boot command (eg. bload"cas:",r), you can now
  paste it by pressing Shift+Ctrl+V
- added MSX mouse and trackball controllers, remember that you can press
  Shift+Ctrl+M to grab the PC mouse cursor

09-01-11: 1.3.2
It's been nearly a year since the last update, coding time was mostly spent
on another project, and MAME. meisei hasn't stood still though; whenever I
noticed a small glitch or annoyance, it was fixed rightaway. This accumulation
of minor fixes and improvements makes it worthwile to do an intermediate
release, so here we go, version++.
