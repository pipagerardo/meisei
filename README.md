# About meisei
meisei 1.3.3 is a free and open-source MSX emulator for Microsoft Windows

The author of the original source code (hap) is missing in action, post-traumatic stress from hundreds of hours coding. The latest version is 1.3.2 and is 32-bit. 

Thanks to yksoft1 for finding and uploading the latest source code https://github.com/yksoft1/meisei to Github.

Now meise is compiled to 64 bits with GCC UCRT with English and Spanish versions. Both Kaillera and Zlib have been updated, along with hundreds of compiler, pointer, and data type warnings. This new version should be more stable, lighter and faster.
