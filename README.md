# About meisei
meisei 1.3.3 is a free and open-source MSX emulator for Microsoft Windows which is why it is not compatible with other operating systems.

It only emulates MSX1 because to be honest, few of us had an MSX1 and even fewer had an MSX2, I didn't know anyone with an MSX2 back in the day. If anyone wants to collaborate with this project, welcome.

The author of the original source code (hap) is missing in action, post-traumatic stress from hundreds of hours coding. The latest version is 1.3.2 and is 32-bit. 

Thanks to yksoft1 for finding and uploading the latest source code https://github.com/yksoft1/meisei to Github.

Now meise is compiled to 64 bits with GCC UCRT with English and Spanish versions. Both Kaillera and Zlib have been updated, along with hundreds of compiler, pointer, and data type warnings. This new version should be more stable, lighter and faster.
